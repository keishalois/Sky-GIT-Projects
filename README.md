Sky Get Into Tech Projects
A little repo to show the projects I have worked on during the Get into Tech course.

Sky's 'Get into Tech' training programme is an initiative aimed at increasing the number of women in technical roles. This is an intensive 4 month course, developing skills as a software developer, specifically:
- Awareness of Technology and current trends in software development
- Agile delivery
- Software development â€“ PHP; JavaScript; HTML & CSS
- Object Oriented Programming
- Databases; MySQL
- Software build and integration
